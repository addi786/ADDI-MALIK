Movies.com is your all-new ultimate destination for...that's right, everything movies. Whether you want to read up on the latest movie news, find out what's coming soon in theaters or on DVD, get movie times, or just can't think of the name of that actor in that movie and need to know now, we've got it covered. Action, sci-fi, thrillers, horror -- we love them, you love them, and we're here to help you learn more about old favorites and discover new ones.

Visit our Trailers section for the latest video, our Reviews section for the critics' take, our exclusive News + Features for blogs, articles, news and more. See photos from the latest Hollywood events, and find out everything you wanted to know about your favorite stars. Access your favorite theaters quickly to buy movie tickets online (hey, Fandango, America's number one ticket seller, is our sister site, so you know it'll be easy breezy). Along with our new look and feel we are continually expanding and getting better, so make sure to keep checking back for what's new (and let us know what you'd like to see).

So there you have it. With all that to do, stop reading this and go check out the site. As Alfred Hitchcock once said, "The cinema is not a slice of life, but a piece of cake."
